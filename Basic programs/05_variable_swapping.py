# Practice Problem: Write a program to swap the values of two variables, a and b, without using a third temporary variable.

# Exercise Purpose: This exercise will help you learn about memory efficiency and Python’s special tuple unpacking feature. In other languages like C or Java, you need a temporary variable to swap values safely. In Python, you can swap values in one line without risking data loss.


a=10
b=20

print("Before swapping:")

print(f"Value of a = {a} and value of b = {b}")

a,b=b,a # hidden tuple unpacking

print("After swapping:")
print(f"Value of a = {a} and value of b = {b}")
