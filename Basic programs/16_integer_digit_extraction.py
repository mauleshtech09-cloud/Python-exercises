# Practice Problem: Write a program to extract each digit from an integer in the reverse order.

# Exercise Purpose: This exercise explores “Mathematical Parsing.” Instead of converting a number to a string, use the modulo operator (%) and floor division (//) to isolate digits. This is common in low-level programming and algorithm challenges where type conversion is restricted.


num = int(input("Enter number : "))

while num > 0:

    digit = num % 10

    num = num // 10

    print(digit, end=" ")
