# Practice Problem: Create a list of 5 fruits. Add a new fruit to the end of the list, then remove the second fruit (at index 1).

# Exercise Purpose: This exercise teaches “Dynamic Collection Management.” Lists are rarely static; being able to modify, expand, and prune them is essential for handling data like shopping carts, user lists, or inventory systems.

fruits=["Apple","Banana","Cheery","Date","Blueberry"]

fruits.append("Fig")

fruits.remove("Banana")
