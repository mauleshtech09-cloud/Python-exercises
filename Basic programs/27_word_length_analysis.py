# Practice Problem: Create a list of 5 words. Write a loop that iterates through the list and prints each word alongside its character count.

# Exercise Purpose: This exercise introduces “Metadata Extraction.” Often, you aren’t just interested in the data itself, but in its properties. In web development, this logic is used to validate if a user’s password or username meets specific length requirements.


words = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry", "Date", "Elderberry"]

for word in words:
    
    length=len(word)
    
    print(f"{word} = {length}", end ="  ")
