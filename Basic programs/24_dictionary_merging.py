# Practice Problem: Write a program that takes two separate dictionaries and merges them into one single dictionary.

# Exercise Purpose: This introduces “Key-Value Consolidation.” Merging dictionaries is a common task when combining configuration files or user profiles. It also teaches you about “Key Overwriting”—what happens when both dictionaries share the same key.


dict1={"name" : "Alice", "age": 25}
dict2={"city": "New York", "job" : "Enginner"}


merged_dict= dict1 | dict2

print(merged_dict)
